# Thesis Code: Data-to-Text Transformation with Machine Learning

This code is part of the thesis conducted by **Vemmos Tasos** for the **Department of Management Science and Technology** at the **Athens University of Economics and Business**. The thesis, titled _"Data-to-Text Transformation with Machine Learning: Literature Review and Empirical Research on Greek Dataset Creation,"_ aims to showcase the performance of four models based on a Greek table-to-text dataset.

## Thesis Overview
The primary goal of this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning models in transforming structured data into coherent textual descriptions. This research involves:

- **Dataset Creation**: Developing a Greek table-to-text dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of four different models using established metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics
For each dataset, well-established metrics such as **BLEU**, **METEOR**, and **ROUGE** were used to automatically evaluate each model's performance. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the models' ability to generate accurate and meaningful text from data.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes the following components:

- **Models Notebook**: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for training and evaluating the models.
- **Preprocessing Scripts**: Scripts used for preprocessing the dataset.
- **Dataset**: The actual dataset created in the research.
- **Initial Datasets**: The initial datasets queried from Wikidata.
